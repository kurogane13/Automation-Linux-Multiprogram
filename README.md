# Linux-Multiprogram
Linux and network automation tasks, developed in python2.7 and bash.

This program works in Ubuntu and Debian distros.

"Multiprogram", is a set of scripts, and many programs, that all together create a "Linux and network automation
tasks program".

There some scripts and programs that will work if executed alone, be it with bash, or python,
but many of them depend on others.

You should COPY ALL THE UPLOADED FILES TO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY, and when running them you will need to provide your 
root password.

The main programs are: 

-Multiprogram-new-1-server-colored.py
-Multiprogram-new-1-server.py
-Multiprogram-Tkinter-new-1.py
-Multiprogram-Tkinter.Desktop

You should create the following folders, for ssh, and telnet scripts:

in the home folder create:

a folder named: cisco-ssh-access-scripts-logs

a folder named: cisco-telnet-access-scripts-logs

Inside of each of the above directories, create the following subdirectories:

create folder: check-device-network-status

create folder: running-configs


To get a button console version of the Multiprogram, copy ( with sudo )  Multiprogram-Tkinter.Desktop to your linux Desktop.
This is a button that will be placed in your desktop, to launch the button console.

To run the Multirpogram from a command line gnome-terminal,

You can either run :

python Multiprogram-new-1-server.py

or

python Multiprogram-new-1-server-colored.py




I hope you can try it out, and let me know if you like it, just let me know if there is some stuff that does not work well.

Regards to all.

Gus.
